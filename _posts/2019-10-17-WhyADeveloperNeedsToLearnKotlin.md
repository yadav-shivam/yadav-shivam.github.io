I have keep this article very short and crisp without going with any technical words or codes.  I would suggest you to read it completely and make a choice to learn. </p><h3><strong>1. It makes development faster a lot faster&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Gone are those days when developer wrote large number of line of codes just to print simple "hello world"</p><p>This is the new era of programming languages where developer's life become very easier. Faster development means faster delivery.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. You don't to need to cry anymore for the quality of your app.</strong></h3><p>Yes it's true the quality of the app you build with Kotlin will be improved.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally developers can get rid of a famous nightmare word "null"</p><p>Kotlin improves the quality of your released apps through “safety” features that have been designed to reduce the number of bugs and system failures.</p><h3><strong>3. Compatible with Existing java libraries&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>What else a developer need if a modern programming language is compatible with your own loved language Java.&nbsp;</p><p>You don’t need to stop using Java—you can use both! Extension functions give you a way to add functionality to existing classes (even Java classes) without a full rewrite to Kotlin.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4. Official support by Google for Android development</strong></h3><p>Recently google said in it's conference that "35% of pro developers use Kotlin … more and more Android development is going to Kotlin and we’re committed for the long term.”</p><h3><strong>5. Large open community at your door</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/community/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kotlin developer community</a>&nbsp;is a great resource for expanding your knowledge, and is growing rapidly. The&nbsp;<a href="http://slack.kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kotlin Slack channe</a>l is particularly active and is regularly recommended by new developers.</p><p><br></p><p>If you're convinced a little with my words then let's give it a try, you can thank me later and I know you'll for sure.&nbsp;</p><p>Happy Coding! </p><p> </p></div>
